# Todo
- [ ] Split "ABOUT API DOWNLOAD" into 3 <h1> tags in a 3-column grid and set the top-margin to 0 (which removes the white strip at the top of the page)
- [ ] Rewrite every header tag (and the <title> tag) to only capitalize the first letter (except for API, that's fine how it is)
- [ ] Add vertical padding to the first div there (the one with the logo)
- [ ] Set the column in that first div to be 30% 70%, and center the logo within its own side
- [ ] Add horizontal padding to the About and API sections so the text has some space from the edge of the page
- [ ] Set the color of the <h3> tags I added to the API section to white
- [ ] Center the logos in the download section and make then a little smaller (but the NPM logo is an okay size since it's shorter than the other two)
- [ ] Set the <a> tag colors to the light blue color
