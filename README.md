# Todo
- [ ] About, API and Download in the header should all be h1 tags, but with margin-top:0
- [ ] Make the title tag say Lödr
- [ ] Center the Lödr logo horizontally
- [ ] Add horizontal padding to the About and API sections so the text has some space from the edge of the page
- [ ] Center the logos in the download section and make then a little smaller (but the NPM logo is an okay size since it's shorter than the other two)
- [ ] Add a media query that collapses the css grids into 1 column when the window is less than 750 pixels wide
- [ ] In the API section, align the function names with the p tags below them (they should align on the left-hand side)
